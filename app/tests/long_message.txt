Deborah “Debbie” Lynn Peterson was a caring wife, mother, grandmother, sister, and friend. She left this world suddenly on July 6, 2020 at age 56.

She was born to Craig and Donna Sanders on June 23, 1964. After graduating from high school, Debbie chased her dreams to serve abroad in the Peace Corps where she met her husband, John Peterson. Together, they had 3 children: Brenda, Chad, and Emmy.
Debbie loved spending time in the kitchen, creating delicious meals for her family. Neighborhood children would gather around the kitchen table for after-school cookies and loved listening to Debbie’s stories about her travels. She was a skilled piano player and filled her home with classical music. Most weekends were spent as a volunteer at the local soup kitchen.
A funeral service is scheduled for 11 am on July 9, 2020 at the Presbyterian church on the corner of State Street and Broadway. In lieu of flowers, please donate to the downtown soup kitchen on her behalf.
